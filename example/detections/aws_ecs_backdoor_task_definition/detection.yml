# description: Detects when an Elastic Container Service (ECS) Task Definition has been
#     modified and run. This can indicate an adversary adding a backdoor to establish
#     persistence or escalate privileges. This rule is based on examining events created
#     upon execution of Rhino Security Lab's Pacu in a lab environment.
